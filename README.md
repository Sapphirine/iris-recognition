## Abstract
Iris recognition is a fast-growing area with high potential for future biometric recognition. This area is not yet mature enough for a wide range of applications. However, with the development of more sensitive human iris camera and more accurate iris-recognition algorithms, iris recognition can potentially be the one of the most accurate and convinient  way to identify a person. In this area, the majority of the papers propose a traditional way to recognize iris patterns, which requires mathematical transformations. In recent years, some researchers have shifted their focuses to deep learning methods. The traditional method is more popular because these pre-processing steps find the iris patterns in a very direct way. Compared with the traditional methods, deep learning is claimed to be unreliable since it will learn non-iris features from the training images. Therefore, the goal of our paper is to explore the potential of deep learning on iris recognition. Our research found that if the quality of iris images is high, deep learning can have a better performance than the traditional method. With pre-processing steps, such as iris localization, on iris images before deep learning, the test performance may be lower, but the practical performance will be better because in this way, the deep learning algorithm will make predictions mostly based on the iris patterns.
